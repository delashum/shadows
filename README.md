# Shadows

Design shadows visually

## TODO

- when hover on body you can copy box shadow CSS and it hides lights completely
- NTH support light / dark (don't go with theme, just toggle). Use recessed style icons for this
- separate state for light / dark mode as they need to be finetuned separately
- NTH allow setting background colors for box and background. Just do css? Give them a textarea with monospace and label all objects with an ID they can target?
- NTH allow customizing box shape/size could used recessed icons like dark mode in top left. just 4 options or something like that
- how to do things (e.g. dbl click to remove light, meta_click to add, etc) could just all be listed on left by other controls. Lights can go over these controls tool
